Here is the repository for managers, thinkers, protocol designers, etc:

Please, if you have any idea you'd like to share, ask me to include you into the repository. You will be part of the initial capital partition by putting here your papers.
If you don't know how to use github, please ask me to include your docs and I will do it for you.
I recommend using Lyx/Latex for writing the papers, so we have a consistent format. http://www.lyx.org/

Right now we need coordinators, economists, lawyers, and protocol designers. Programmers are welcome too, in the other repository.
If in doubt of anything, don't hesitate to contact us by PM, email, or in #wetube on Freenode.
